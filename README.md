# Snake-Game 🎮

A fun and interactive browser-based snake game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project brings the classic snake game into your browser.  
Control the snake with the keyboard, eat food to grow, avoid collisions with walls or your own tail.  
Clean UI, simple mechanics, and great for demonstrating DOM manipulation + game logic.

## 📌 Features  
- Use arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to control the snake’s direction.  
- The snake grows each time it eats the “food” item.  
- Game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own tail.  
- Score counter displays how many food items you’ve eaten.  
- Responsive layout to work well on different screen sizes.  
- Sound effects for eating food and game over: `food.mp3`, `gameover.mp3`, `move.mp3`, `music.mp3`.
